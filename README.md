# Multi-Master SQL API Sample for .NET

This sample demonstrates how to implement conflict resolution with a multi-master enabled Cosmos DB database. This solution includes a conflict generator class that will intentionally attempt to create conflicts. It also includes three different conflict resolution mode samples so you can see how conflicts are resolved.

## Getting Started

Should only need to open the solution in VS and restore Nuget packages to get it compiled. Next open app.config and edit the endpoint and key to your Cosmos DB account.
